# Summarizer
This is a text summarizer that uses the algorithm created by [Shlomi Babluki](https://thetokenizer.com/2013/04/28/build-your-own-summary-tool/).
For information how to execute to the program....

### Running the Program
1. First download the ZIP file of the Summarizer Program. Decide if you would like to summarize in multi-threading or single-threading by commenting the corresponding code within the improved_summary.java file.
2. Open your terminal and go to the directory where you stored the program.
3. Run the following the command --> **javoc** **Summarizer** **file1** **file2** -->
Note: The file1 and file2 are the names of the files you would like summarized. 
You should keep adding the names of files you would like summarized, with a space in between.
4. Each file will have a output text, named fileoutput.txt. For example, if I want to summarize a file called 'article', the summarized file will be named 'articleoutput.txt'.
 

### Thoughts
Overall, this program was something done for fun! I don't have any desire to expand what this program does, but if I were to give it some changes, I would do the following. </br>
First, I would make it easier for the program to distinguish paragraphs because currently, this program defines a paragraph as two newlines at the end of some text.
Second, be able to extract the body of URL website and summarized an article from the web. All in all, this project was something fun and cool to see work in action.
specifying what a paragraph is (two new lines)
scanning a url website,
